## Interactive Online Resume Project
Comleted as part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1) program. For more detailed info on the requirements, please see the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/?_ga=1.189245867.12280332.1465333852#!/projects/2962818615/rubric).

In this project **jQuery** and **Object-Oriented Programming** were used to develop an interactive resume application that reads all data from a **JSON** file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. Further CSS customization was done to personalize the resume.
